# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview/Objective:
The Typing Speed and Accuracy Tracker is a web application built using React that aims to help users improve their typing skills while monitoring their typing speed and accuracy. The primary goal of the project is to create an engaging and interactive platform for users to practice typing, enabling them to track their progress over time.

## Key Features:

### Real-time Typing: 
The application provides a user-friendly typing interface where users can see the text they need to type. As they type, the application instantly highlights any mistakes, providing immediate feedback to enhance accuracy.

### Speed Calculation: 
Utilizing the useEffect and useState hooks in React, the application calculates and displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) as they complete typing exercises.

### Accuracy Assessment: 
The application evaluates the user's accuracy by comparing their input against the provided text. The accuracy percentage is displayed to users, motivating them to reduce errors and improve accuracy.

### Progress Tracking: 
To encourage continuous learning, the application saves users' typing scores and accuracy data. Users can review their historical data, identifying trends and areas for improvement.

### Responsive Design with Bootstrap: 
The project leverages the Bootstrap framework to ensure the application's responsiveness and compatibility across different devices and screen sizes, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

####Through this project, users can enhance their typing skills in an interactive and fun way, with the ability to set personal goals and track their progress over time. The combination of React's useEffect and useState hooks facilitates real-time updates and seamless data handling, while Bootstrap ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
